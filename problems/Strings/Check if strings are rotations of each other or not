/*

You are given two strings of equal lengths, s1 and s2. The task is to check if s2 is a rotated version of the string s1.

Note: The characters in the strings are in lowercase.

                  Example 1:
                  
                  Input:
                  geeksforgeeks
                  forgeeksgeeks
                  Output: 
                  1
                  Explanation: s1 is geeksforgeeks, s2 is
                  forgeeksgeeks. Clearly, s2 is a rotated
                  version of s1 as s2 can be obtained by
                  left-rotating s1 by 5 units

        // Your code here
        int n1=s1.length();
        int n2=s2.length();
        
        if(n1!=n2){
            return false;
        }else{
                StringBuilder temp=new StringBuilder();
                temp.append(s1);
                temp.append(s1);
                if(temp.lastIndexOf(s2)>=0){
                    return true;
